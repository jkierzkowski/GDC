First download and install docker engine, more informations are available here -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
Then pull the image with "sudo docker pull jankierzkowski/neutrino_genie" command.

Instructions for opening Genie in the Docker image "neutrino1.1":

1.Running the image:
For basic Docker image configuration, run the Bash script RunDockerNeutrino.sh.
IMPORTANT: Before running the script, ensure that you have created an environmental variable named GENIE_IM_WDIR with the path to the directory on your computer where you want to store files generated with the container.

2. Accessing JupyterLab:
If you have executed the script successfully, you should see some links to the JupyterLab server. Choose the link that starts with 127. and use it to access JupyterLab in your web browser.

3. Uploading files:
To upload files, click the upload arrow in the upper left corner menu of JupyterLab and select files from your computer. The chosen files will appear in the /opt/Home folder in the container.
All files in the $GENIE_IM_WDIR folder on your computer correspond to the /opt/Home folder in the container. This means you can add files to the $GENIE_IM_WDIR folder, and they will appear in the /opt/Home folder in the container, and vice versa.

To access the root and GENIE, open a terminal in the JupyterLab's Launcher tab.
